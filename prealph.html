        Four years ago this project was entitled Bug Catcher Elliot. This was before I knew anything about Unity. From then I have created and had to recreate the current build for projectLit. During that time period I have familiarized myself with the Unity Framework and Adobe Services, but know I have a lot to learn and utilize. <br><br>I have created all game objects sprites myself but these are placeholders at the momement. Currently, I am attempting to master the manipulation of computer graphics. I learned to manipulate Unity's 2D physics system by playing around with attributes and methods attatched to the Rigidbody2D object type to simulate my representation of telekinesis and a few funtions of other superpowers. The current build is only available for PC and Mac. <br><br>The W , A, S, and D keys control the characters actions such as walking, jumping. Fighting is controlled by E key as combos and directional keys. Blocking is controlled by Q key. Blocking and Fighting have been turned off currently. The mouse controls the super powers and are represented as a character specific cursor. I coined these super powers as Spirit for this game. A player has health, stamina, and spirit bars that limit character actions. I am currently working on syncronizing player cursor interactions across the Photon Unity Network.</p></div>

        Finish sync issues:Once Finished Alpha can begin testing<br>
Finish Run and Gun style:Focus on Game Feel<br>
Fix Z-plane features<br>

Create Display Text Object: for communication; for tutorial; try comic bubble style implementation<br>
Rework Consumables/Interactive items: give player buffs/nerfs; have a durability;<br>
Rework Back pack<br>
Finish Interactive map:Program different natural disasters to promote pvp interaction if idleness is present; program varying amounts of traffic: vehicles, pedestrians, animals; <br>my main focus to produce alpha would be vehicles and different types of public transportation<br>
Implement sound-currently no sound; some soundbites recorded; search for free generic sounds to save time<br>
Update UI-especially opening screen; Private room play; Offline/Practice mode; pause menu; character select ui; character menu.<br><br> Once most of the problems above have solutions Alpha Testing may begin. </p></div>

Environment interactions/AI<br>
Focus on Sound-different game interactions-ui, pvp, pve, music and develop changes within the environment around the music's rhythm<br>
Enemies-Everything:AI, Animation, sprites<br>
<br>
Implement Light/Shadows:Refine Art and Animation<br>
Powers/Environment as players<br>
Finish Brawler style:Animate-UI<br>
Different Game Modes:non-common gamemodes;IE Hide and Seek<br> 
<br><br> Once Alpha Testing is complete Beta Testing may begin. </p></div>
